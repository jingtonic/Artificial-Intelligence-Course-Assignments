# Course-Assignments_AI

The respository includes the assignments I did for the course Artificial Intelligence. 

In assignment 1, I developed a machine learning pipeline. The pipeline included preprocessing steps, feature scaling using the StandardScaler, and logistic regression modeling with the "liblinear" solver. The goal was to predict the overall Human Freedom Index based on selected features, while handling missing values through appropriate imputation strategies. The resulting pipeline enabled accurate predictions by leveraging the trained logistic regression model.

In assignment 2, following assignment 1, but I tried to optimize the hyperparameters during the model training while at the same time to test different models such as decision tree, randome forest, and logistic regression. At the end I identified the hyperparameter combination with the best performance.
