# Course-Assignments_AI

The respository includes the assignments I did for the course Artificial Intelligence. 

In Assignment 1, I developed a machine learning workflow. The pipeline included preprocessing steps, feature scaling using the StandardScaler, and logistic regression modeling with the "liblinear" solver. The goal was to predict the overall Human Freedom Index based on selected features, while handling missing values through appropriate imputation strategies. The resulting pipeline enabled accurate predictions by leveraging the trained logistic regression model.
